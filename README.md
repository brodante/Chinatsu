# Chinatsu

**Chinatsu** is a C++ game engine project designed as a personal challenge and a showcase of my C++ skills. This project aims to deepen my understanding of game engine fundamentals by building core systems from scratch and tackling complex graphics programming. 

### Project Inspiration

The name **Chinatsu** (千夏) means "Thousand Summers" in Japanese, symbolizing warmth, energy, and the pursuit of beauty—all qualities I hope to bring into this engine. I drew inspiration for the name from one of my favorite manga series, *Ao no Hako* (Blue Box), where the main character, Chinatsu Kano, embodies determination and strength. Just as her character pursues her dreams with unwavering dedication, this project represents my commitment to mastering C++ and game development.

### Features (Planned)

- **Rendering Engine**: Physically-based rendering (PBR), shaders, and custom lighting techniques.
- **Scene Management**: Handling multiple game objects, scene hierarchies, and real-time interactions.
- **Physics and Collision Detection**: Basic physics engine to simulate movement and detect collisions between game entities.
- **Scripting Support**: Extendable scripting capabilities for customization and ease of use.

### Technologies

- **C++17/20**: Core language for the engine, utilizing advanced language features to maximize performance.
- **OpenGL/Vulkan**: Graphics APIs to provide cross-platform rendering.
- **SDL2**: Input handling and window management.
